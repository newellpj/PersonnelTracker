You have a web app manifest file, which defines how your app appears on the user's system and how it should be launched

The manifest must have a `short_name`, a name for display in the banner,

A start URL (e.g. / or index.html) which must be loadable,

At least an `144x144` PNG icon

Your icon declarations should include a mime type of image/png

You have a service worker registered on your site. We recommend a simple custom offline page service worker

Your site is served over HTTPS (service worker requires HTTPS for security)

The user has visited your site at least twice, with at least five minutes between visits.
