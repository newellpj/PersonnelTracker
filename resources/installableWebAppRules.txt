You have a web app manifest file, which defines how your app appears on the user's system and how it should be launched

The manifest must have a `short_name`, a name for display in the banner,

A start URL (e.g. / or index.html) which must be loadable,

At least an `144x144` PNG icon

Your icon declarations should include a mime type of image/png

You have a service worker registered on your site. We recommend a simple custom offline page service worker

Your site is served over HTTPS (service worker requires HTTPS for security)

The user has visited your site at least twice, with at least five minutes between visits.


If installation fails, we're not so good at telling you about it

If a worker registers, but then doesn't appear in chrome://inspect/#service-workers or chrome://serviceworker-internals, it's likely failed to install due to an error being thrown, or a rejected promise being passed to event.waitUntil().

To work around this, go to chrome://serviceworker-internals and check "Open DevTools window and pause JavaScript execution on service worker startup for debugging", and put a debugger statement at the start of your install event. This, along with Pause on uncaught exceptions, should reveal the issue.

Send a request from the command line for FCM to push a message

server key: AIzaSyDfNnFAH8REJ51ENImY3Lg6Guv9CePAcYM

FCM will match your servey key with the Sender ID you got from the Firebase Developer Console, which matches the gcm_sender_id value in the manifest. 

curl --header "Authorization: key=<PUBLIC_API_KEY>" --header "Content-Type: application/json" https://android.googleapis.com/gcm/send -d "{\"registration_ids\":[\"<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>\"]}"

authorization key is your server key
